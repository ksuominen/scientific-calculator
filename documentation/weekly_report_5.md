# Week 5

This week, I have done manual testing. I have also completed the implementation document, the testing document, and the user guide. I also did the first peer-review. 

I think I'm about done with the program and the documents. Next I'll double-check the documents and see if I can come up with more suggestions for improvement. I'll also check the peer-review that I'll hopefully receive, and see if they had any suggestions I could take into consideration. 

Time spent: approx. 4 hours
