# Week 3

This week, I have added the use of several functions (min, max, opposite number, abs, sqrt, sin, cos, tan). I have written the function for parsing the multidigit numbers and floats from the user's input. I have also written more unittests. I have added some more buttons to the ui so I could test the calculator via the ui also. I created the first version of testing document, although at this point it only contains the coverage report. This week I learned how to handle the functions in shunting yard algorithm.

I think the core functionality of the calculator is about done. Next I'll focus on adding all the buttons to the ui and putting them in some logical order. I also need to implement saving the result to a parameter and to create the implementation document and the user guide.

Time spent: approx. 5 hours
