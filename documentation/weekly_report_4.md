# Week 4

This week, I have finalized the UI. I also implemented saving the result to a parameter, and also the result from the last calculation (Ans) can be used. I created the first draft of implementation document. I also created a crude draft of the user guide. I updated the testing document a little. 

I am quite happy with the program, it seems to work well. I still need to do more manual testing, cross-referencing with an actual scientific calculator. The design of the UI is very basic (kinda retro), but since appearance isn't to my understanding that important on this course, I'm not going to spend more time on that. In addition to manual testing, I need to complete the implementation document, testing document, and user guide. And next week is also the first peer-review. 

Time spent: approx. 6 hours
