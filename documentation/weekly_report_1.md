# Week 1

This week, I have set up the project repository, created project definition, familiarized myself with the shunting yard algorithm, and taken a look at the reverese polish process to create the final output after using shunting yard. I have also browsed the materials of the 'Ohjelmistotekniikka' course, since I haven't completed it yet.

I think I've gotten a hang of how the algorithm works, and I've learned how to set up a Python project using poetry, as well as the basics of how to run unittests. I decided to try to implement a graphical user interface using Tkinter, since I think that handling the user input from graphical ui might be easier than from a text-based ui. I haven't implemented a graphical ui before, but Tkinter seemed simple enough.

Next I'll start building the ui and drafting a simple version of the shunting yard algorithm. I thought I'd start with a simple version that handles the basic arithmetic operations, and gradually add complexity to it. I'll also have to create the algorithm for solving the reverse polish notation quite early on. At this point I don't have any specific problems or questions.

Time spent: approx. 8 hours
