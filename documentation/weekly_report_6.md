# Week 6

This week, I updated the GUI a bit to work better also on other operating systems, and updated the documentation based on the peer-reviews. I also did the second peer-review and added some docstring. 

I received some useful feedback from the peer-reviews, especially regarding the gui. I'm using Windows myself, and in my OS the buttons fitted to the window. However, it turned out that with some other OS the buttons didn't fit to the window, making the calculator hard to use. Tkinter is new to me, and I think it is not very practical how things are sized with it. But I hope I got the gui working better now. 
During the weekend I need to prepare for the demo session, I will not include those hours here.

Time spent: approx. 2 hours
